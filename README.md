# Property Issue Tracker (prototype) 🏠🌳
## What is it?
Hi there 👋, thanks for checking out this repo. This is my prototype for a property issue tracking application which is inspired by my previous career.  

## Tell me a little bit more please
I worked in the social housing sector before becoming a software engineer. Part of my role was to report and keep track of estate issues within the community, such as fly tipping, street repairs and the like.  
Traditionally this part of the role was conducted via the use of several disparate manual processes, unspecialised software and paper-based filing systems.  
This is my attempt at creating specialised software in order to make the process more simple and focussed.  

## Why a prototype?
I would like to see initially what _can_ be achieved and how to achieve it, without being attached to the idea of making it perfect.  
If I do continue with this idea and create a fully-fledged application, it would be handy to have somewhere to mess around with concepts before implementing them fully.  

# Functionality
## What is the general idea of this app?
In short, this app is intended for capturing 'issues' which could be bringing down the quality of a property/ estate/ area of land and a means of tracking them. It helps operatives as they have a centralised place to capture and monitor both their own and colleagues' estate issues.  

## Who is the target demographic?
Anyone who looks after a property/ bit of land really, for example:
- An estate inspector
- Caretakers/ janitors
- Residents interested in the upkeep of their local area
- Owners of large areas of land

## What should it be able to do by the end?
I have a few features in mind for what this app should do:
- ✨ **Create** an identified 'issue' (something that needs attention on the property/ land)
- 📖 **Read** existing issues
- 🔨 **Update** existing issues
- 🗑️ **Delete** issues
- 📜 Show a list of all issues
- 🔍 Some kind of simple search mechanism
- ✅ 'Close' an issue as resolved

# Tips for using this repo
## Can I contribute?
You are more than welcome to take a fork of this repo and browse issues, but because:
- It is merely a prototype
- It is to display my progress on a personal project
- It is not intended for public use

I am unfortunately not accepting contributions.  

## What is your workflow?
If you are interested in following the progress of this app, my workflow is as follows:
1. An issue will be created for a unit of functionality
2. I will raise a pull request when a chunk of development is complete
3. I'll repeat this process until the prototype is complete
