# Property Issue Tracker (prototype) 🏠🌳
## What is it?
Hi there 👋, thanks for checking out this repo. This is my prototype for a property issue tracking application which is inspired by my previous career.  
  
## Tell me a little bit more please
I worked in the social housing sector before jumping into the world of software development. Part of my previous role was to report and keep track of estate issues within the community, such as fly tipping, street repairs and the like.  
  
Traditionally this part of the role was conducted via the use of several disparate manual processes, unspecialised software and paper-based filing systems.  
This is my attempt at creating specialised software in order to simplify the process and make all the aspects more joined-up.  
  
## Why a prototype?
I would like to see initially what _can_ be achieved and how to achieve it, without being attached to the idea of making it perfect.  
  
If I do continue with this idea and create a fully-fledged application, it would be handy to have somewhere to mess around with concepts before implementing them fully.  
  
# Functionality
## What is the general idea of this app?
In short, this app is intended for capturing 'issues' which could be bringing down the quality of a property/estate/area of land and a means of tracking them. It helps operatives as they have a centralised place to capture and monitor both their own and their colleagues' estate issues.  
  
## Who is the target demographic?
Anyone who looks after a property/ bit of land really, for example:
- An estate inspector
- Caretakers/ janitors
- Residents interested in the upkeep of their local area
- Owners of large areas of land
  
## What should it be able to do by the end?
The prototype should be able to:
- ✨ **Create** an identified 'issue' (something that needs attention on the land/property)
- 📖 **Read** existing issues
- 🔨 **Update** existing issues
- 🗑️ **Delete** issues
- 📜 Show a list of all issues
- 🔍 Some kind of simple search mechanism
- ✅ 'Close' an issue as resolved  
  
## Just seems like a basic CRUD application, why are there not more features?
I am trying to get something as bare basic as possible which I can then potentially re-do in another language (this prototype will be in .NET MAUI).  
  
Other basic features I have thought of but are currently out of scope are:
- 👷‍♀️ User log in
- ☁️ Remote storage of records (bit of a hack but will just be stored locally in a JSON file)
- 💬 Commenting on issues
- ⚗️ Unit tests (😮 I know, right? Even as a firm believer in TDD, I am not letting unit tests get in the way of messing about with a prototype. My main focus is on experimentation and seeing what MAUI can do)
  
## Any future plans?
Yes! I would like to try a few prototypes first in one or two more languages and all being well, I would like to choose the right one and develop a real, fully functional application.
